# profile

This is my profile page built using a React, Node and Express.  Visitors to this profile have the option to download a pdf copy of my resume on the about page and send me an email through the contact form using Nodemailer on the contact page.  React Router v2.8 was used to build the routes to different sections.

The projects page lists some of the more notable apps I have developed during my time in the Northwestern Full-Stack Coding Bootcamp and the publications page lists the peer-reviewed scientific publications on which I am an author.

MongoDB functionality has been added, but it is not used at present.
