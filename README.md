# profile

This is my profile page built using a MERN stack.  Additionally, the visitor to this page has the option to download a pdf copy of my resume and send me an email through the contact form using Nodemailer.

The projects page lists some of the more notable apps I have developed during my time in the Northwestern Full-Stack Coding Bootcamp and the publications page lists the peer-reviewed scientific publications on which I am an author.
